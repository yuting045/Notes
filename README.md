# Notes
ls: lists all files in the current directory
cd <path to directory>: change into the specified directory
mkdir <directory name>: make a new directory with the given name
mv <source path> <destination path>: move the file at the given source to the given destination
  
In addition to + operator (addition), the - operator (subtraction), the * operator (multiplication) and the ** operator (exponentiation), there are three division-like operators to remember:
Floating point division (/): divides the first number number by the second, evaluating to a number with a decimal point even if the numbers divide evenly
Floor division (//): divides the first number by the second and then rounds down, evaluating to an integer
Modulo (%): evaluates to the positive remainder left over from division

 Names are bound to values, not expressions.
